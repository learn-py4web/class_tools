## Setup

To use these scripts, you need to create credentials for Google Drive.
Here is how to proceed: 

To create a Google credentials JSON file for accessing Google Drive, navigate to the Google Cloud Console, go to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials", then create a new "Service Account" and select "JSON" as the key type to download a JSON file containing your access credentials; this file is typically named "credentials.json" and should be stored securely as it contains your private key information. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Key steps: [1, 2, 3]
* Access Google Cloud Console: Open the Google Cloud Platform console and select your project. [1, 2, 3]
* Go to Credentials page: Navigate to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials". [1, 2, 3]
* Create a Service Account: Click "Create Credentials" and select "Service account". [1, 2, 3]
* Name your Service Account: Provide a name for your service account. [1, 2, 4]
* Add a Key: Select "Add Key" > "Create new key". [1, 2, 3]
* Choose JSON format: Set the "Key type" to "JSON" and click "Create". [1, 2, 3]
* Download the JSON file: A JSON file containing your credentials will be downloaded to your computer.  Name it `credentials.json` . [1, 2, 3]

## Checking Google Drive sizes: 

```python
python ls.py -d <max_depth> <folder_id>
```



## Grading for py4web de Alfaro Assignments

Every assignment has a source version, which is private to instructors and used to develop the grading, and a student version, which is shared with students. 

## Grading

There are two steps in grading an assignment: downloading it, and grading it. 

The package accesses Google Drive; you need to have this credentials.json file. Please do not share it. If it leaks, it does not grant anyone access to anybody elseâ€™s Drive, but it still uses resources from a cloud project that is not for public use. 

### Downloading an assignment

```
python download_submissions.py -s <sheets_id> -d <submission_folder>
```

where: 

`sheets_id` is the ID of the google sheets corresponding to the submissions form.  If the URL of the sheet is: 

`https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/something/edit`

then the ID is the `something` portion. 

`submission_folder` is the directory where you want the result to be stored.  There will be one folder per student, named student@ucsc.edu (with student replaced by the student actual email id), with in it already unzipped, the student submission. 

The download code has many options; feel free to explore them. 

### Grading an assignment

To grade an assignment, do: 

```
python grade_submissions.py -d submission_folder -g ../assignment1-source/grade 
```

In other words, 
* `-d` is the folder where the submissions are, 
* `-g` is the path to the grading file in the source assignment, not in the student assignment (students can tamper with it). 

The result will be a grades.csv file in the submissions folder. 

## Uploading grades

This can be done with the [py-canvas](https://github.com/edulinq/py-canvas) package. 
A sample command line is: 

```
python3 -m canvas.cli.assignment.upload-scores --config <path_to_config.json> --course <course_number> <assignment_number> path/to/grades.csv --skip-rows 1
```

You can get the assignment number by listing the assignments, via: 

```
python3 -m canvas.cli.assignment.list --config <path_to_config.json> --course <course_number>
```
